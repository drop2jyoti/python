The formula for exponential growth is `population_size = N0 *e**rt`, where `N0` is the initial population, `e` is the exponential function, `r` is the rate, and `t` is time. Using this:\n","\n","1.   Set the initial population, `N0`, as 100 and the growth rate, `r`, as 0.4\n","2.   Use the suitable `numpy` function to generate an array of time points, `t`, which go from 0 to 10 seconds, in 0.2 second increments.\n","3.   Write an expression to evaluate `population_size`, which should be an array of the population size for each time point in `t`.\n","4.   Create a new variable called `population_size_noise`, use the same expression you wrote in parts (3), and add noise to the population at each time point. Do this by adding an expression that uses a `numpy` function to generate a random value for each time point drawn from a normal distribution of `mean=0` and `stdev=250` (i.e., population_size_noise = expression_from_part_a + expression_to_add_noise)."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":7,"status":"ok","timestamp":1668296875008,"user":{"displayName":"Kaylie Lau","userId":"01284785813595846851"},"user_tz":300},"id":"ULSswoS4EhRs","outputId":"6d541d46-0b4f-4300-9d52-bfd6d4877aff"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Population size   [ 100.          108.32870677  117.3510871   127.12491503  137.71277643\n","  149.18246976  161.60744022  175.06725003  189.64808793  205.44332106\n","  222.55409285  241.08997064  261.16964734  282.92170144  306.48542033\n","  332.01169227  359.66397256  389.61933018  422.0695817   457.22251951\n","  495.30324244  536.55559711  581.24373944  629.6538261   682.09584693\n","  738.90560989  800.44689143  867.11376585  939.33312874 1017.56743061\n"," 1102.31763806 1194.12644178 1293.58173155 1401.32036077 1518.0322245\n"," 1644.46467711 1781.42731796 1929.79717555 2090.52432351 2264.63796432\n"," 2453.25301971 2657.57726999 2878.91908792 3118.69581683 3378.44284638\n"," 3659.82344437 3964.63940726 4294.84259788 4652.54744398 5040.04447781\n"," 5459.81500331]\n","Noise : [ 106.00265828  692.63462408  -42.75668684  263.4026899   255.75274535\n","  115.14558525   78.73387233 -140.56612026  106.3687504    59.33439047\n","  408.50790192  347.73048223  563.69410424  256.13418743   25.1435455\n","  461.8425568   283.38881312  416.24908722  455.98255256  388.66295204\n","   13.79275089  433.09892887  386.3728553   460.03541623  868.17579762\n"," 1158.09482652  776.0775467   919.19638653  888.17425846 1457.57710801\n","  908.32036012 1306.7502476   864.85393552 1300.56550654 1600.81685321\n"," 1692.71152371 1738.78596353 1563.2825985  2213.29800882 2801.97296683\n"," 2346.2410639  2715.9455749  3170.27629239 2976.45195984 3753.92812752\n"," 3702.55026389 3956.53287346 4162.13186686 4883.87324447 5174.52374387\n"," 5613.40917425]\n"]}],"source":["# Your code here\n","import numpy as np\n","N0 =100\n","growth_rate = 0.4\n","t = np.arange(0, 10.2, 0.2) # stop is set to 10.2 as increments are 0.2 \n","population_size = N0 * np.exp(growth_rate * t)\n","print(\"Population size  \", population_size)\n","population_size_noise =   N0 * np.exp(growth_rate * t) + np.random.normal(0,250, np.shape(population_size))\n","print(\"Noise :\", population_size_noise)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["<details>\n","  <summary>Answer</summary>\n","\n","  ```python\n","  import numpy as np\n","\n","  #set initial population\n","  N0 = 100\n","  #set growth rate\n","  rate = 0.4\n","  #create array of time points \n","  t = np.arange(start=0, stop=10.2, step=0.2)\n","\n","  #calculate population of colony at the time points in t\n","  population_size = N0 * np.exp(rate*t)\n","  print('Population size is: ',population_size)\n","\n","  #add noise to population at each time point\n","  population_size_noise = N0 * np.exp(rate*t) + np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=250, size=np.shape(population_size))\n","  print('Population size with noise is: ',population_size_noise)\n","  ```\n","</details>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"QmxvYhS3OCNJ"},"source":["### 2.
